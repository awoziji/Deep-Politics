This is the model dataset folder obtained by splitting the cropped folder files into classes for training and validation. Therefore, this folder should have the following structure:
- train
	- derecha
	- izquierda
- validation
	- derecha
	- izquierda

Due to privacy concerns, I can't include these files here. You could get your cropped portraits from Internet and test the project scripts.
